Loot
====

This is an inventory management system for Pathfinder. It is intended to be used for storing party communal treasure. Everyone should have easy access. Additionally, a GM can precreate bags of treasure to easily dump them into the party treasure pool.

Getting started
---------------

If you just want to use this, there should be a working demo [here](http://loot.meteor.com/).

If you would like to run your own, you will need to install [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). After that, clone the directory and start the project by running ``meteor``.
